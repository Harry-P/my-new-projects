## 🎓 How to Use This Course

### 🚀 Starting the Server (IMPORTANT - Do This First!):

**The server is already set to run continuously** - Once started, it will serve all lessons automatically!

1. Open a terminal in VS Code
2. Navigate to the course folder: `cd "C:\Users\hpers\OneDrive\Documents\my-new-project\VS-Code-Learning-version-3"`
3. Start the server: `python -m http.server 3000`
4. The server will keep running in the background

**The server automatically serves:**
- Main page: http://localhost:3000/index.html
- Lesson 01: http://localhost:3000/Lesson01/index.html
- Lesson 02: http://localhost:3000/Lesson02/index.html
- All other lessons...

**The server will keep running until you:**
- Close VS Code
- Stop the terminal manually
- Restart your computer

**You don't need to restart the server for each lesson** - it serves all lessons continuously! 🎉

### 🌐 Opening Lessons in Simple Browser (Manual Method):

**Method 1: Using Command Palette**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open Command Palette
2. Type: `Simple Browser: Show`
3. Press Enter
4. Enter the URL in the address bar:
   - Main page: `http://localhost:3000/index.html`
   - Lesson 01: `http://localhost:3000/Lesson01/index.html`
   - Lesson 02: `http://localhost:3000/Lesson02/index.html`
   - Pattern: `http://localhost:3000/LessonXX/index.html`

**Method 2: Right-Click (Easiest!)**
1. In VS Code Explorer, find any lesson's `index.html` file
2. Right-click on `index.html`
3. Select **"Open in Simple Browser"**
4. The lesson opens directly!

**Note:** Simple Browser is a built-in VS Code feature - no extension needed! 🎉

### Starting a Lesson:

1. Make sure the server is running (see above)
2. Open Simple Browser to http://localhost:3000/index.html to see all lessons
3. Click on any lesson card to start
4. Read the educational material carefully
5. Take the quiz - you need **all 5 questions correct** to proceed
6. Complete the hands-on activities in VS Code
7. Verify your work honestly at the end

### The Learning Flow:

```
📖 Material → 📝 Quiz → 🎯 Activities → ✅ Verification
```

Each lesson follows this structure:

- **A) Material Section** - Learn concepts with examples
- **B) Quiz Section** - 5 multiple-choice questions
- **C) Auto-Check** - Must answer all correctly to unlock activities
- **D) Activities Section** - Practical tasks (13-18 per lesson)
- **E) Verification** - Confirm you actually did the work

---

## 🔒 Verification System

### Why Verification?

We've built a system to ensure **genuine learning**:

- Activities are grouped (3 groups per lesson)
- Popups appear only when completing entire groups
- Final confirmation dialog lists specific tasks
- Both "Complete" and "Verified" flags are saved
- Prevents students from just clicking checkboxes

### How It Works:

1. Check off activities **as you actually complete them**
2. When you finish a group, a popup confirms progress
3. At lesson end, a dialog asks: **"Did you REALLY do this?"**
4. Be honest! This system helps you learn, not just collect checkmarks

---

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Your progress is automatically saved in your browser's localStorage:

- ✅ **Completed Lessons** - Green checkmark badge
- 🔒 **Verified Lessons** - Blue verification badge  
- ⏳ **Not Started** - Gray badge
- 📈 **Progress Bar** - Visual completion percentage

### Viewing Progress:

- Main page shows completion stats (X/10 completed)
- Each lesson card displays status badges
- Progress persists between browser sessions
- 🏆 Completion banner appears when all 10 lessons done

### Resetting Progress:

Click the **"Reset All Progress"** button on the main page (requires double confirmation).
