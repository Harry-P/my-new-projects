## 🎬 Let's Create Your First File!

### Step-by-Step: Creating a File

```
STEP 1: Open VS Code
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Find VS Code on your        │
│  computer and open it        │
│                              │
│  You should see the          │
│  welcome screen              │
└─────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
STEP 2: Create New File
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Click: File → New File      │
│                              │
│  OR                          │
│                              │
│  Press: Ctrl + N (Windows)   │
│         Cmd + N (Mac)        │
└─────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
STEP 3: See Your Blank Page
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  You now have an empty       │
│  page called "Untitled-1"    │
│                              │
│  Ready to write!             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## ✍️ Activity 1: Write Your First Lines!

Let's write something fun. Copy this into your new file:

```
Hello, World!

My name is [Your Name]

Today I learned how to use VS Code!

This is my very first file in VS Code.
I feel like a real programmer! 🎉

Things I want to learn:
1. How to make websites
2. How to create games
3. How to build cool stuff
```

**Replace `[Your Name]` with your actual name!**

---

## 💾 Saving Your Work (Super Important!)

Now let's save this file so you don't lose it:

### The Save Process:

```
METHOD 1: Using the Menu
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  File → Save                         │
│                                      │
│  A window will pop up                │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
METHOD 2: Keyboard Shortcut (Faster!)
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Press: Ctrl + S (Windows)           │
│         Cmd + S (Mac)                │
│                                      │
│  This is what pros use!              │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
CHOOSE A NAME AND LOCATION
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Pick where to save (Desktop?)    │
│  2. Name your file: "my_first_file"  │
│  3. Add .txt at the end              │
│     Example: "my_first_file.txt"     │
│  4. Click "Save"                     │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🎨 Understanding File Names:

```
   my_first_file  .  txt
   ─────┬────────  ┬  ─┬─
        │          │   │
    File Name    Dot  Extension
   (What you    (Separator) (File Type)
    call it)
```

**File Extensions Tell Your Computer What Kind of File It Is:**
- `.txt` = Text file (plain writing)
- `.html` = Webpage file (we'll use this later!)
- `.css` = Style file (makes things pretty)
- `.js` = JavaScript file (makes things interactive)

## 📂 Creating a Folder for Your Work

Let's get organized! Professional coders keep their files in folders.

### Step-by-Step: Create Your Coding Folder

```
STEP 1: Make a Folder on Your Computer
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Go to your Desktop or Documents    │
│                                     │
│  Right-click → New → Folder         │
│                                     │
│  Name it: "My-Coding-Projects"      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
STEP 2: Tell VS Code About Your Folder
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  In VS Code:                        │
│  File → Open Folder                 │
│                                     │
│  Find your "My-Coding-Projects"     │
│  folder and click "Select Folder"   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
STEP 3: See Your Folder in VS Code
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Look at the left side (Explorer)   │
│  You should see your folder name!   │
│                                     │
│  Now all your files will be here    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🗂️ How Folders and Files Work Together

Think of it like a filing cabinet:

```
🗄️ FILING CABINET (Your Computer)
│
├─📁 Drawer 1: My-Coding-Projects (Your Main Folder)
│  │
│  ├─📄 my_first_file.txt
│  ├─📄 my_story.txt
│  └─📁 Week1-Practice (A folder inside a folder!)
│     ├─📄 practice1.txt
│     └─📄 practice2.txt
│
├─📁 Drawer 2: School Work
│  ├─📄 math_homework.txt
│  └─📄 essay.txt
│
└─📁 Drawer 3: Fun Stuff
   └─📄 game_ideas.txt
```

**Organization Tip:**
```
Good Structure:
My-Coding-Projects/
  ├── Lesson-1/
  ├── Lesson-2/
  └── Practice/

Bad Structure:
Desktop/
  ├── file1.txt
  ├── randomstuff.txt
  ├── asdffile.txt  ← Hard to find things!
  └── untitled123.txt
```

---

## 🎮 Activity 2: Create a Story File

Let's practice! Create a new file and write a short story:

### Your Task:

1. **Create a new file** (Ctrl + N / Cmd + N)
2. **Write a story** - Be creative! Here's a starter:

```
The Mystery of the Missing Code
================================

Once upon a time, in a computer far, far away...

[Continue the story here - make it fun!]
Write at least 5 sentences.
```

3. **Save it** in your "My-Coding-Projects" folder
4. **Name it:** `my_story.txt`

**Bonus:** Add some emojis to make it fun! 🎨🚀🌟

---

## 🔄 Opening Files You've Saved

Now that you have files, let's learn to open them:

### Method 1: Using the Explorer (Left Side)

```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│  MY-CODING-PROJECTS        │  ← Your folder name
│  ├─📄 my_first_file.txt   │  ← Click on any file
│  └─📄 my_story.txt        │     to open it!
└────────────────────────────┘
```

### Method 2: Using the Menu

```
File → Open File
→ Find your file
→ Click "Open"
```

### Method 3: Recent Files (Quick!)

```
File → Open Recent
→ See your recently used files
→ Click one to open it instantly!
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips: Working with Files

### Tip 1: Multiple Files Open at Once

```
You can have many files open!
They appear as TABS at the top:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [my_first_file.txt] [my_story.txt] [+] │  ← Click tabs to switch!
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│   Your file content here                │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Tip 2: Split Screen (Work on Two Files!)

```
Right-click a file tab → "Split Right"

┌──────────────┬──────────────┐
│  File 1      │  File 2      │  ← Work on both at once!
│              │              │
│              │              │
└──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

### Tip 3: Auto-Save (Never Lose Your Work!)

```
File → Auto Save ✓

Now VS Code saves automatically!
No more losing your work!
```

## 📝 File Naming Best Practices

### Good File Names ✅

```
my_first_file.txt
lesson_2_practice.txt
my_awesome_story.txt
project_ideas.txt
```

**Why these are good:**
- Easy to read
- Use underscores `_` instead of spaces
- Descriptive names (you know what's inside!)

### Bad File Names ❌

```
asdf.txt                 ← What is this?
new file.txt             ← Space will cause problems!
untitled123.txt          ← Not descriptive
ALLCAPS.txt              ← Hard to read
```
